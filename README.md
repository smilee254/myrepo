## 📌 Project Overview
The **Income Deficiency Compensation System (IDCS)** is a specialized fintech platform designed to mitigate income volatility for Kenyan gig workers and professionals. By leveraging **Gemini 1.5 Flash** for OCR and **Facebook Prophet** for time-series forecasting, IDCS predicts income "dips" and provides a structured framework for parametric compensation.

🏙️ Built for Nairobi
From the iconic KICC to the Times Tower, IDCS is architected to understand the unique cash-flow patterns of the Nairobi market, specifically focusing on M-Pesa transaction velocity.
